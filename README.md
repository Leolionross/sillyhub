# sillyhub
goofy roblox script hub that has a few scripts, hopefully much more in teh future.

---

## run the script

to run the stable version of sillyhub, run the loadstring from my servers
`loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://leolionross.dev/files/scripts/sillyhub.lua'))()`

for a most likely in development version load from github
`loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Leolionross/sillyhub/main/sillyhub.lua'))()`
